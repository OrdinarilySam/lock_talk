# Lock Talk

The idea is to create a simple visualization for what happens to data being encrypted over an insecure channel.

Right now AES cipher and inverse cipher works and I plan to compile it into webassembly and make a website that 
shows two parties able to communicate and the data cycling through the real states it goes through to be sent
over an insecure channel.
